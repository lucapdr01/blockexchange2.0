# blockexchange2.0
In this project I tried to create an exchange platform where users can trade Bitcoin.
My focus on this project was on the Back-end but all the basic functionalities are accessible interfacing with the basic UI I designed.
Users can register and receive a random amount of BTCs that can be traded in the platform. Trades are based on the OrderBook model
each order filled is stored in a MongoDB database with all it's necessary information. The platform is able to partially fill orders
when needed.
